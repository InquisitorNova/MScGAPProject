This is a modified Res-UNet implementation that builds upon the work of Jackson Haung
(https://github.com/jaxony/unet-pytorch/)
and Alex Krull. 
https://github.com/krulllab/GAP/blob/main/gap/GAP_UNET_ResBlock.py
I have modifield the UNet to be incorporated into the GAP Framework, adding additional features
such as the ability to use different activation functions, and the ability to use different
amounts of layers in the ResBlock.
